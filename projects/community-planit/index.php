								<a href='http://communityplanit.org' target='_blank'>Community PlanIt</a> is playful and dynamic way to 
								give input to city officials for long-range strategic 
								planning, while rallying around awards for local causes, 
								connecting with others in your community, and gaining a 
								sense of empowerment in the process of active of civic engagement.

							<p>
								Our elected officials and civic leaders often seek community input when trying to imagine
								the best solutions to complex issues - like infrastructure, community health, transportation,
								or land use - and formulating strategic plans that will take into consideration the actual 
								needs of the community at large. With our busy schedules and other pressing obligations, it 
								is often difficult, if not outright impossible, for people to attend in-person town hall meetings
								where input is given, costs and benefits are debated, and decisions get made. Even if 
								one can attend, sometimes not everyone feels comfortable standing up before others and 
								giving their opinion. Other times, meetings get dominated by the loudest voices in the 
								room, not always the most prudent or knowledgeable. In order to broaden access the public
								deliberative process, the very cornerstone of our country's democratic foundation, 
								Community PlanIt provides a platform that allows people to engage in a discussion of
								matters that will directly impinge on their day-to-day lives. By lowering the barriers 
								for participation, removing such obstacles as scheduling conflicts, discomfort with 
								public speaking, transportation, or simply boredom or disenchantment with public processes, 
								Community PlanIt makes it feasible  for everyone with a stake in their neighborhood to have 
								a say in its future.
