								Civic leaders and town planners often seek community input when trying to imagine solutions to complex issues that take into consideration the actual needs of the community. With our busy schedules and other pressing obligations, it is often difficult, if not outright impossible, for people to attend in-person town hall meetings where input is given, costs and benefits are debated, and decisions get made.
 
								Even if one can attend such official gatherings, not everyone feels comfortable standing up before others and voicing their opinion. Meetings can be dominated by the loudest voices in the room, not always the most prudent or knowledgeable.
 
								To lower the barriers for participation we must remove obstacles:
									scheduling conflicts									discomfort with public speaking
									lack of transportation or simple boredom or disenchantment with public processes.

							<h2>The Game</h2>
							<p>
								<span>The Goal</span> Complete challenge questions and themed missions to earn 'coins' that you can pledge to help win money for local causes while contributing a real-world planning process.
							</p>
							<p>
								<span>Stake in the Conversation</span> <em>Tell your story, make your voice heard and connect with others in your community</em>
								Community PlanIt is not just an online survey, nor is it a gimmicky digital suggestion box, both of which can feel merely pro forma or ineffectual to those who use them. Community PlanIt's player profiles not only give planners valuable information about who is offering input, but also allows other players to understand your stake in the issue based on how you identify (student, homeowner, business owner, city planner, etc.) and how you affiliate yourself (by neighborhood, membership in community organizations, belonging to a certain school).
 							</p>
 							<p>
								When you know a little bit about the players you're interacting with, it's easier to engage in a conversation with some sense of their perspective. And people may surprise you, confounding your preconceived notions of what a business owner or a middle school student might have to say about a matter!
							</p>
 							<p>
								<span>It's About Community-Building</span> <em>What if I know nothing / know everything about this topic?</em>
								Players without much expertise get the chance to learn about the issues as they advance through the missions, thanks to in-game resources and knowledge shared by other players. Meanwhile, real experts get the chance to pass on what they know through the Soapbox and interactive Comments sections. Overall knowledge of the community increases, solutions are arrived at organically, and good ideas rise to the top.
 							</p>
 							<p>
								<span>Three Weeks / Three Missions</span> <em>Why time-limited games?</em>
								Planning projects have deadlines to meet in various phases, and if community input is to have a meaningful effect on decision-making, then it needs to happen in a concentrated way. In the context of an online game, players have a chance to reflect on their opinions and those of others through a series of thematically linked challenge questions that unfold over the course of a week. This time limit creates a fun sense of urgency for players as the clock ticks down, even as it gives players ample time to play using the resources embedded in the game or doing their own research to inform their answers. Meanwhile, interacting with other players who have responded to challenge questions, opens up dialogue- and earns you points.
