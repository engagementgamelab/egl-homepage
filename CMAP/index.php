                The MA in Civic Media, Art &amp; Practice is an intensive 12-month program centered around the production of a creative thesis project, situated within the theories and methodologies explored during coursework. Through the lasting connections forged with organizational partners they encounter during their year in the program, CMAP graduates will be well-positioned to create their own avenues for work across a range of careers -- from leadership roles in innovation offices of municipal governments, to creative digital roles at foundations and corporations focused on implementing technologies for civic engagement in non-profit, governmental or for profit industries that focus on social responsibility.</p>

              CMAP is supported by a core of faculty from Emerson College who are Engagement Lab Fellows. This group consists of nine professors from across the college (School of Arts, School of Communication, and the Institute for Liberal Arts and Interdisciplinary Studies). Their mission is to cultivate an intellectual community at Emerson College committed to research, pedagogy and practice of civic media. Our fellowship program is at the core of this mission, bringing together faculty from the Emerson community, and beyond, to build intellectual capacity for <em>engaged research</em>--research with direct application to peopleâ€™s lives and livelihoods.

              Each summer, CMAP students interested in the education field or global development work may opt to serve as teaching assistants in the Salzburg Academy of Media and Global Change, working with undergraduates from all over the world to guide their own rapid prototyping of civic media projects. During the intensive three-week long academy, students study how culture, media, and technology can impact social movements, civic life and governance. This provides CMAP students the unique opportunity to teach others what they have learned, core to the pedagogical mission of the program. </p>
