							 <p>The core experience and outcomes of the CMAP program are centered around thesis projects. Students should think of the 12-month experience as structured primarily by creative works that they are expected to produce, in certain cases scaled projects in partnership with an external organization. These projects will highlight the relationship of media, art, and practice that the program strives to explore, across a wide range of approaches to the art &amp; design of civic media: e.g., a participatory digital campaign, mobile app, public art installation, interactive curriculum, virtual platform, or game. These projects will bring to life the theories and practices that CMAP students explore throughout the year.</p>

							<h2 class='funTitle'>Core Courses</h2>
							<p>
								<span>Topics in Media Studies </span> The core seminar course will be required in fall and spring semesters and introduce students to such core theoretical principles of civic media as critical media studies, public and political art, theories of democracy, social movements and governance. In addition to understanding the primary theoretical debates, students will learn methodological approaches such as participatory action research, grounded theory, design research, ethnography, content analysis, and social network analysis.
							</p>
							<p>
								<span>Civic Media Design Studio</span> This two-class sequence introduces concepts, methods and practices of civic media. The studio provides opportunity for students to make media in expressive or design modalities, and to develop skills in working with partners. The studio will provide a guided space in which to critically evaluate case studies in Civic Media and develop production, project management, and evaluation skills. Students hone collaborative development and production skills that correspond with their project.
