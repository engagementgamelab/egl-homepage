									Like real-world programs and projects, games involve decisions with consequences. The development and humanitarian sectors confront challenges and opportunities in a changing context dominated by complexities, volatilities and uncertainties. An increasing body of evidence shows that participatory games can help people and organizations &ldquo;inhabit&rdquo; the complexity of risky decisions, allowing us to explore, then test a range of plausible futures. Albert Einstein once said that &ldquo;games are the most elevated form of investigation&rdquo;. When adequately designed, games can capture essential aspects of reality: through simple rules, games create emergent complexity that meaningfully engages us in learning and dialogue about options and outcomes - in a way that is both serious and fun. They can also help to facilitate complex and difficult professional processes and provide a mechanism for players/participants to be more creative and provide better input.
								</p>
								<p>
									<em>This workshop aims to provide the fundamentals of how practitioners can harness the power of serious gameplay to support humanitarian and development initiatives.</em> Combining presentations, intensely interactive game sessions, plenary discussions, and creative work in small groups, this workshop will familiarize students with recent developments in game-enabled approaches to learning, dialogue design and implementation processes, providing a solid foundation for innovative practices and processes, be it training, project design, participatory evaluation, fundraising, or new partnerships.

								<em> <strong> The workshop can be 2-3 days and can be adapted for different groups. It has been held in Bratislava, Slovakia with the UNDP and Lugano, Switzerland with the Red Cross.</strong> </em>

								VM 420: Games and Social Change - Spring 2013/2014
							</h2>
							<p class='professor'>
								PROFESSOR ERIC GORDON
							</p>
							<p class='course'>
								The video game industry is one of the largest sectors of the entertainment industry. But the importance of games goes well beyond industrial silos. Games and game mechanics are factoring into the experience of television, film and the web, and increasingly, into other institutions, including education, democracy and health. What's more, games are being deployed in these contexts to produce real world social change. This class provides students with an introduction to games and game design and gives them the opportunity to partner with the Red Cross / Red Crescent in designing games for real people to solve real humanitarian problems. Students will work in groups, each with a specific geographic and content focus, to design board (or otherwise analog) games and digital prototypes that will be tested and deployed. Prerequisites: Junior standing and some programming or design experience is ideal, but not required.

							</p>
							<p class='course'>
								Global Media Literacy, a summer course that convenes in Salzburg, Austria at the <a href='http://salzburg.umd.edu/'>Academy on Media & Global Change</a>  explores how digital media technologies are shaping civic engagement, activism, and innovation in a global media age. Students work in a truly dynamic global cohort of fellow university students from 15 partner institutions, to build digital stories, business plans, and content that helps provide innovative insights into the role of media, technology, and activism in changing societies across borders, across cultures, and across divides. Specifically, the course examines how distinctive global media shape views of politics, culture and society within nations, across regions and internationally. GML will help students develop an informed and critical understanding of how media shape and influence society and communication in the global public sphere. The course will develop a critical understanding of ideas around participatory technologies, collaborative media, social networks, mobile platforms and digital culture. This past summer, the partner for our course was the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Knowledge, Innovation and Capacity Group.
